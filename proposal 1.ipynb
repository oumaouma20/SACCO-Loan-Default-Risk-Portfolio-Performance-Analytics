    "## 1. Project Title\n",
    "**Data-Driven Credit Risk Assessment and Loan Portfolio Optimization for a SACCO**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Problem Statement\n",
    "Many SACCOs face persistent challenges such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rising loan default rates  \n",
    "- Weak or subjective credit assessment processes  \n",
    "- Over-reliance on guarantors without data-backed validation  \n",
    "- Limited analytical reporting for management decision-making  \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, loan decisions are often reactive rather than predictive.  \n",
    "This project applies **actuarial risk principles and Python-based data analytics** to assess loan default risk and improve SACCO loan portfolio performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Objective\n",
    "To estimate and analyze loan default risk among SACCO members using data-driven and actuarial methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secondary Objectives\n",
    "- Identify key drivers of loan default  \n",
    "- Segment SACCO members into risk categories  \n",
    "- Evaluate overall loan portfolio performance  \n",
    "- Support data-backed loan approval and monitoring decisions  \n",

    "\n",
    "## 4. Data Description (Simulated SACCO Data)\n",

    "- `DefaultRiskScore` (proxy for Probability of Default)  \n",

    "\n",
    "## 5. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation\n",
    "**Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the SACCO dataset  \n",
    "- Validate data types and structure  \n",
    "- Check for missing values and inconsistencies  \n",
    "- Create derived variables:\n",
    "  - Risk category (Low / Medium / High)  \n",
    "  - Expected loss per member  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "**Tools:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key analyses include:\n",
    "- Member distribution by ward  \n",
    "- Total monthly contributions by ward  \n",
    "- Loan portfolio size and outstanding balances  \n",
    "- Delinquency rates across wards  \n",
    "- Relationship between membership tenure and default risk  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Actuarial Risk Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "This project applies core actuarial concepts to SACCO lending.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Loss (EL) Model:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "EL = PD \\times LGD \\times EAD\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **PD** = DefaultRiskScore  \n",
    "- **LGD** = Assumed constant (e.g., 45%)  \n",
    "- **EAD** = Outstanding loan balance  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs:**\n",
    "- Expected loss per member  \n",
    "- Total expected loss for the SACCO  \n",
    "- Ward-level expected loss distribution  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Risk Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Members are classified into:\n",
    "- **Low Risk:** PD < 0.20  \n",
    "- **Medium Risk:** 0.20 ≤ PD ≤ 0.50  \n",
    "- **High Risk:** PD > 0.50  \n",
    "\n",
    "This segmentation supports:\n",
    "- Risk-based loan limits  \n",
    "- Targeted monitoring  \n",
    "- Focused interventions for high-risk members  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Loan Portfolio Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The SACCO loan portfolio is evaluated using:\n",
    "- Total loan book size  \n",
    "- Outstanding loan balances  \n",
    "- Non-performing loan (NPL) rate  \n",
    "- Ward-level risk concentration  \n",
    "\n",
    "This enables management to identify **underperforming segments** and concentration risk.\n",

    "- Members with shorter tenure tend to have higher default risk  \n",
    "- Delinquent loans contribute disproportionately to expected losses  \n",
    "- A small group of high-risk members accounts for most portfolio risk  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
