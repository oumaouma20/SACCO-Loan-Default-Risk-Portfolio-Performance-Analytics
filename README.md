# SACCO Loan Default Risk & Portfolio Performance Analytics

## Overview
This project demonstrates how **data analytics and actuarial risk principles** can be applied to SACCO lending to assess loan default risk, evaluate portfolio health, and support data-driven credit decisions.

The analysis uses a **simulated SACCO dataset of 100 members** across four wards in Ugenya Sub-County:
- East Ugenya
- West Ugenya
- North Ugenya
- Ukwala

---

## Objectives
- Estimate loan default risk among SACCO members
- Segment members into risk categories
- Evaluate loan portfolio performance
- Apply actuarial Expected Loss modeling
- Generate actionable insights for SACCO management

---

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Member demographics (age, gender, ward, tenure)
- Savings behavior (monthly contribution)
- Loan details (loan amount, outstanding balance, status)
- Default risk score (proxy for Probability of Default)

---

## Methodology
1. Data loading and cleaning using Python
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Actuarial Expected Loss modeling
4. Risk segmentation (Low, Medium, High)
5. Portfolio performance assessment

---

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Optional: Power BI / Excel for dashboards

---

## Key Outputs
- Expected loss estimates
- Ward-level risk analysis
- Risk-based member segmentation
- Portfolio health insights
